* [React JS] - Developers design and implement user interface components for JavaScript-based web and mobile applications using the React open source library ecosystem.
* [Node.js] - A Node. js developer is responsible for writing server-side web application logic in JavaScript and/or variants of it, such as CoffeeScript, IcedCoffeeScript, etc.
* [Android] - Android software development is the process by which a new application is created for the Android operating system.
